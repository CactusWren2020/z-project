A Create-React-App based blog.

Features:
1. Display blog posts
2. Editable posts
3. Upload and display pictures
4. Create, authenticate, keep track of users
5. Hooked into Firebase

Much of this is based on Zack Gordon's React Book, but I added the image upload and the user creation features. And chose the pictures, although I'm not responsible for the content some users uploaded!

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
